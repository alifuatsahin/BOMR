        "Our environment consist of a white surface with Aruco markers on the different corners to be able to identify them using the webcam given to us. We first decided to use a white surface with a black grid but then decided to go with a fully white surface instead because we use a binary threshold to detect our obstacles which would then interpret the grid as an obstacle. To correct this we would had needed to specifically extract the grid to create a mask out of it and substract it to our image in order to not detect it as an obstacle but we would not need this if we used a simple white surface. We also decided that the obstacle were not just squared one and therefor the use of a grid made less sense.\n",

The obstacle used for the global navigation are black objects because as said before we use a binary threshold to detect them and blakc works the best for this situation, and the one used for the local avoidance are white objects because since they have the same color as the surface they are not detected with our image processing program."
