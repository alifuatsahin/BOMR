Our local avoidance was done using a form of ANN (artificial neural network), this type of local avoidance being chosen as it allowed the robot to move quite smoothly."

If it is good, an other check will be done to verify if we are walking down the path or trying to go back to it. A final check is made to see if we are far enough from the goal, as there is no point in making a local avoidance if we are already on the goal."
