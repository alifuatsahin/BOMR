# Thymio Robot Navigation Project

## Introduction

Welcome to our Thymio Robot Navigation Project! In this project, we have developed an autonomous robotic system using the Thymio robot. Our system is capable of complex navigational tasks such as global and local navigation, obstacle avoidance, and precise motion control. Utilizing advanced algorithms like Extended Kalman Filter for state estimation and differential drive control, we've created a robust platform capable of navigating through dynamic environments with varying obstacles.

The project is structured into several key modules, each handling different aspects of robotic navigation. The main components include environment setup, pathfinding, motion control, pose estimation, and obstacle avoidance.

## Run the Project

Run the main.py file using Python:


```python
    python main.py
```

## What to Expect

The script will execute the predefined tasks, including navigating through the environment, avoiding obstacles, and reaching designated targets. You will be able to observe the robot's behavior and how it applies the algorithms for navigation and obstacle avoidance.
